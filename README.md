# Eye_Straining_Color_Reliefer
Eye-Straining Color Reliefer
A real-time screen and window capturing tool that applies a color filter to reduce eye strain from overly saturated or bright colors.

Overview
This application provides a simple and effective way to view content on your screen with reduced color intensity. It can capture either your entire screen or a specific application window, process the video feed in real-time to desaturate harsh colors, and display the filtered result. This is particularly useful for users who are sensitive to bright colors or work for long hours in front of a screen. The project features a Google Meet-style selection menu, allowing the user to easily choose what they want to share and filter.

Features
Real-Time Color Filtering: Applies a custom filter to reduce the saturation of straining colors on the fly.

Gmeet-Style Selection UI: A simple graphical user interface to choose between sharing the entire screen or a specific application window.

Full Screen Capture: Mirrors your entire primary monitor with the color filter applied.

Application Window Capture: Mirrors a specific window you select from a list of all open applications.

Modular and Clean Codebase: The project is structured into logical modules for easy understanding and modification.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following Python files:

app_launcher.py: The main entry point for the application. It launches a Tkinter GUI that allows the user to select their desired capture mode.

capture_screen.py: Contains all the logic for capturing the entire screen using the mss library.

capture_window.py: Contains the logic for capturing a specific application window, also using mss and pygetwindow to identify and track the window.

replace_straining_colorss2.py: The core image processing module. It contains the replace_straining_colors function, which performs the color desaturation on each frame.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher

Windows 10 or 11 (as pygetwindow works best on Windows)

2. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone your repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (on Windows Command Prompt)
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

4. Install Required Libraries
With your virtual environment activated, install all the necessary packages using pip:

pip install opencv-python mss pygetwindow numpy

How to Use
Launch the Application: Run the app_launcher.py script from your terminal:

python app_launcher.py

Make a Selection: A selection window will appear.

To share your entire screen, click the "Share Screen" button.

To share a specific window, click its name in the list and then click the "Share Selected Window" button.

View the Filtered Stream: A new window will appear, showing the captured content with the color filter applied.

Stop the Capture: To stop the stream, make sure the display window is active (click on it) and press the 'e' key on your keyboard.

Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

opencv-python: For displaying the video frames.

mss: For fast and efficient screen capturing.

pygetwindow: For finding and getting information about open windows.

numpy: For numerical operations on image data.

tkinter: (Built-in with Python) For the graphical user interface.

Known Limitations
The window capture method uses mss, which takes a screenshot of a screen region. This means that if you move another window on top of the application you are capturing, the overlapping window will also be shown in the stream.
